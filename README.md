# EDA
This project implements a decision tree classifier to predict survival outcomes, using data preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding for categorical variables and normalization for numerical features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model. Performance is assessed with metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix. The trained model is then applied to a test dataset (e.g., Titanic data), generating predictions which are saved to a CSV file for further analysis. This approach demonstrates key machine learning techniques for classification tasks.
